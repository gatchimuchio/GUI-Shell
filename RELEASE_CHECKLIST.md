# Release Checklist

In this repository, "release" means completed product release. Skeleton, preview, alpha, beta, scaffold, and contract-preview states are not release states.

No completed product release may be claimed if any Windows-first v1.0 `release_blocker` remains. GUI-Shell v1.0 is Windows-first: Windows is primary, Linux is the validated development/verification slice, and macOS is an unverified planned portability target.

GUI-Shell v1.0 does not claim verified macOS support. macOS support must not be advertised as supported, ready, or complete until validated on a macOS host.

## Release Blockers

- item: cargo test gate for in-scope Rust helper
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Rust helper validation is required for completed desktop-first v1.0 release. Current run on 2026-05-25 passed.
  required_action: Pass `cd native/rust_helper && cargo test` on the release candidate.
  blocks_release: no

- item: desktop flutter analyze gate
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Desktop Flutter analyze is required for completed desktop-first v1.0 release. Current run on 2026-05-25 passed after `unzip` became available.
  required_action: Pass `cd apps/desktop_flutter && flutter analyze` on the release candidate.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Linux desktop build dependencies gate
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Rust/Cargo, Flutter, `unzip`, and Linux desktop build dependencies are resolved for the development/verification slice. `flutter doctor -v` reports clang 21.1.8, cmake 4.2.3, ninja 1.13.2, and pkg-config 2.5.1.
  required_action: Keep Linux desktop build dependencies installed for development validation; do not treat Linux as final Windows-first product proof.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Linux desktop project configuration gate
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Linux desktop project support is configured and `cd apps/desktop_flutter && flutter build linux` passed on 2026-05-25, producing `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/gui_shell_desktop`.
  required_action: Keep Linux build smoke passing as a development/verification slice.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Linux desktop launch smoke gate
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `./build/linux/x64/release/bundle/gui_shell_desktop` launched successfully under WSLg on 2026-05-25; the first window opened with Dashboard, NavigationRail, Runtime Status, and Invariant Status visible.
  required_action: Keep Linux desktop launch smoke passing, but complete Windows launch smoke before product release.
  blocks_release: no

- item: WSLg libEGL/MESA graphics warnings
  classification: known_limitation
  reason: WSLg emitted libEGL/MESA warnings during Linux desktop launch, but rendering and first-window stability did not fail.
  required_action: Keep documented in release-facing docs and reclassify as `release_blocker` if rendering or stability fails.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows desktop project support generated
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `flutter create --platforms=windows .` generated `apps/desktop_flutter/windows` without overwriting existing `lib/` app code.
  required_action: Keep Windows Flutter desktop project files under version control.
  blocks_release: no

- item: conformance tautology fix
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: authority stripping, approval edit guard, approval status, and recovery ID conformance checks now call production Shell Core code and pass; mutation verification confirmed production authority strip and approval guard weakenings fail conformance.
  required_action: Keep conformance tests importing production implementations; do not reintroduce test-local authority stripping or approval edit guard copies; keep `docs/MUTATION_VERIFICATION.md` updated when this surface changes.
  blocks_release: no

- item: ghost invariant measurement
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: state snapshot invariant flags now come from measured production `InvariantEvaluator` checks instead of static false values.
  required_action: Keep invariant flags measured and mutation-test intentional violations when invariant surfaces change.
  blocks_release: no

- item: normalization firewall
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Shell Core now normalizes inbound authority-bearing payloads before authority strip; PolicyEvaluator, AdapterLoader, RuntimeCatalog, and BLUE-TANUKI authority trace use shared normalization scanners; conformance covers Unicode, case, zero-width, alias, envelope, and value-only escalation attempts.
  required_action: Keep raw payload preservation, normalized projection, quarantine decision, normalization audit metadata, and metadata value-only rejection in authority-bearing ingress paths.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Flutter local Shell Core client
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `ShellCoreClient.local()` reads structured local snapshot JSON and is no longer a direct mock alias; mock mode remains separate for tests and demo data.
  required_action: Keep local snapshot loading covered by Flutter tests and replace fallback diagnostics with installed app data on release candidates.
  blocks_release: no

- item: duplicate authority key definitions
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `packages/shell_core/authority_keys.py` is the single production source of `AUTHORITY_KEYS`; any remaining duplicate authority key definition is a `release_blocker`.
  required_action: Keep production modules importing `packages.shell_core.authority_keys.AUTHORITY_KEYS`.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows Flutter analyze gate
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Windows Flutter analyze passed on a native Windows host.
  required_action: Keep `cd apps/desktop_flutter && flutter analyze` passing on Windows release candidates.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows Flutter test gate
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Windows Flutter test passed on a native Windows host.
  required_action: Keep `cd apps/desktop_flutter && flutter test` passing on Windows release candidates.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows Flutter toolchain verified
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Native Windows Flutter analyze, test, build, and launch smoke passed.
  required_action: Keep Windows Flutter toolchain validation current on release candidates.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows desktop build smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `flutter build windows` passed on a native Windows host and produced `build\windows\x64\runner\Release\gui_shell_desktop.exe`.
  required_action: Keep Windows desktop build smoke passing on release candidates.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows desktop launch smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `.\build\windows\x64\runner\Release\gui_shell_desktop.exe` launched successfully on native Windows; Dashboard, NavigationRail, Runtime Status, and Invariant Status were visible in the first window.
  required_action: Keep Windows desktop launch smoke passing on release candidates.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows installer first-run smoke not passed
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: Windows installed-path first-run evidence has not been recorded in `release_evidence/windows_installed_smoke.json`.
  required_action: Run `installer\windows\collect_installed_smoke.ps1` on native Windows and pass `python tooling\windows_release_evidence.py`.
  blocks_release: yes

- item: Windows Setup Doctor smoke not passed
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: Windows installed-path Setup Doctor diagnostics evidence has not been recorded in `release_evidence/windows_installed_smoke.json`.
  required_action: Run Setup Doctor from the installed Windows app path and pass `python tooling\windows_release_evidence.py`.
  blocks_release: yes

- item: macOS planned portability target unverified
  classification: known_limitation
  reason: no macOS validation environment is currently available, so GUI-Shell v1.0 does not claim verified macOS support.
  required_action: Validate on a macOS host before claiming macOS support as supported, ready, or complete.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows installed-path evidence validator
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `tooling/windows_release_evidence.py` validates installed executable hash, installed-path launch evidence, first-run config/audit evidence, and Setup Doctor non-authority diagnostics before Windows release blockers can clear.
  required_action: Keep evidence validation passing and reject copied, edited, or non-Windows evidence.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows Setup Doctor diagnostics evidence not passed
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: Windows Setup Doctor real diagnostics have not passed for the Windows-first product target because installed-path evidence is missing.
  required_action: Pass Windows Setup Doctor smoke with machine-readable evidence; macOS diagnostics remain planned portability validation.
  blocks_release: yes

- item: validate_all.py strict release mode not passed
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: Current-host Linux validation may pass, but Windows-first strict release mode must not report release blockers before completed product release.
  required_action: Pass `python3 tooling/validate_all.py --strict-release --desktop-platform=windows`; `--desktop-platform=all` may still fail because macOS is unverified, but that does not block Windows-first v1.0.
  blocks_release: yes

- item: implementation first-run smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `tooling/release_smoke.py` creates first-run config and audit paths, verifies audit directory writability, and confirms installer/setup state grants no authority and silently approves no permissions.
  required_action: Keep implementation first-run smoke passing; native Windows installed-path first-run smoke remains a separate release blocker.
  blocks_release: no

- item: implementation Setup Doctor diagnostics smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `tooling/release_smoke.py` runs structured Setup Doctor diagnostics and verifies all checks remain non-authoritative.
  required_action: Keep implementation Setup Doctor smoke passing; native Windows installed-path Setup Doctor smoke remains a separate release blocker.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Shell Core persistence smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: integrated Shell Core release smoke saves and loads a deterministic state snapshot.
  required_action: Keep integrated persistence smoke passing.
  blocks_release: no

- item: audit chain verification smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: integrated Shell Core release smoke appends JSONL audit events, verifies hash chain linkage, and detects tampering.
  required_action: Keep integrated audit chain smoke passing.
  blocks_release: no

- item: approval edit to rehash to revalidation smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: integrated Shell Core release smoke edits an allowed approval field, recalculates payload hash, and marks the approval `requires_validation`.
  required_action: Keep approval lifecycle smoke passing.
  blocks_release: no

- item: content_visibility UI enforcement smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: desktop Flutter widget smoke confirms redacted approval projection is visible and hidden full payload content is not rendered.
  required_action: Keep UI projection smoke passing.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Runtime Catalog validation and use smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `tooling/release_smoke.py` registers runtime and adapter manifests through production RuntimeCatalog and confirms catalog does not grant authority.
  required_action: Keep Runtime Catalog smoke passing.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Agent Runtime Contract validation and reference smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: `tooling/release_smoke.py` checks workspace boundary, secret path denial, shell permission mapping, and auditable diff behavior through production AgentRuntimeContract.
  required_action: Keep Agent Runtime reference smoke passing.
  blocks_release: no

- item: owner GO missing
  classification: release_blocker
  required_action: Obtain explicit owner GO.
  blocks_release: yes

## Post-v1 Scope Defaults

- item: mobile full release
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 is Windows-first PC desktop unless owner explicitly includes mobile in release scope.
  blocks_release: no

- item: multi-user mode
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 is single-user.
  blocks_release: no

- item: cloud sync
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 is local-first.
  blocks_release: no

- item: marketplace
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 excludes runtime marketplace.
  blocks_release: no

- item: enterprise admin
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 is not enterprise admin scope.
  blocks_release: no

- item: full live Codex / Claude Code / Copilot / Cursor / Devin / OpenHands integrations
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 requires generic Agent Runtime contract and mock/reference agent only.
  blocks_release: no

- item: BLUE-TANUKI product completion
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: BLUE-TANUKI is a consumer/reference runtime, not a GUI-Shell release gate.
  blocks_release: no

## Known Limitation Rule

Known limitations are allowed only if:

- classification: known_limitation
  reason: limitation does not violate v1.0 release criteria
  required_action: Document in README.md and CLAIM.md
  blocks_release: no

- classification: known_limitation
  reason: limitation does not hide safety, authority, audit, recovery, installer, or validation failures
