# Audit Evidence

## Current Evidence

- item: AuditEvent schema requires core audit fields
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: schema validation present

- item: PolicyEvaluator requires audit_event.event_id
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: conformance present

- item: PolicyEvaluator requires audit_event.payload_hash when payload exists
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: conformance present

- item: AuditStore maintains previous hash linkage in memory
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: contract-level implementation present

- item: audit chain tamper detection
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: conformance and release smoke present

- item: Shell Core persistence and audit smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: `tooling/release_smoke.py` passes snapshot save/load, append-only audit chain verification, and tamper detection for the current implementation path.

## Phase B Internal Operation

- item: operator-facing audit chain validation
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Phase B owner operation needs audit status visible from the desktop shell.
  required_action: Keep Audit Timeline and Evidence Center surfaces connected to Shell Core snapshot/evidence data.
  blocks_release: no

- item: audit export verification tooling
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: evidence bundle export exists for development evidence and must remain non-authoritative until measured Windows installed-path evidence passes.
  required_action: Keep `tooling/evidence_bundle.py --check` passing.
  blocks_release: no

## Remaining Release Blockers

- item: measured Windows installed-path audit evidence
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: completed product release still requires native Windows installed-path evidence to prove config/audit initialization from the installed app path.
  required_action: Generate measured `release_evidence/windows_installed_smoke.json` on native Windows and pass `python tooling/windows_release_evidence.py`.
  blocks_release: yes
