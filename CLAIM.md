# GUI Shell Claim Boundary

## Current Status

GUI-Shell is not yet a completed product release.

Current claim: PC-first AI Runtime / Agent Operation Shell with Phase B owner-use completion.

Phase A, personal Windows trial operation, is complete: the Windows desktop build and native launch smoke passed, and Dashboard, NavigationRail, Runtime Status, and Invariant Status were visible. Phase B owner-use completion is complete: the owner can use the desktop shell for daily local operation with visible status, problems, evidence, recovery, trust, runtime, and authority surfaces. External claim hygiene, measured Windows release evidence, OSS release candidate claims, and paid/product QC remain later phases.

GUI-Shell v1.0 is Windows-first. Current-host Linux validation can pass as a development/verification slice, but it is not final product proof by itself. macOS is an unverified planned portability target, and BLUE-TANUKI remains a consumer/reference runtime rather than a GUI-Shell release dependency.

GUI-Shell v1.0 does not claim verified macOS support. macOS support must not be advertised as supported, ready, or complete without validation evidence from a macOS host.

## Current Completed Areas

- item: schema and conformance skeleton
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: passed in development validation with 89 conformance checks; conformance tautology fix resolved by testing production authority stripping and ApprovalQueue behavior; ghost invariants are measured by production InvariantEvaluator; normalization firewall conformance now covers PolicyEvaluator and adapter metadata ingress.

- item: personal Windows trial operation
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: Windows build and native launch smoke passed for owner trial use; this does not satisfy completed product release readiness.

- item: Flutter local Shell Core client
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: `ShellCoreClient.local()` reads structured local snapshot JSON and is no longer a direct mock alias; mock mode remains available for tests/demo.

- item: GUI operation surfaces
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: Trust Center, Authority Map, Audit Timeline, Recovery Playbook, Adapter Catalog, Permission Diff, Problems Panel, Evidence Center, Settings UX, Command Palette, and Status Bar vocabulary are present as Shell Core-bound operator surfaces.

- item: Shell snapshot and evidence bundle
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: `tooling/shell_snapshot.py` provides structured local GUI state and `tooling/evidence_bundle.py --check` validates a development evidence bundle while preserving Windows installed-path blockers and `release_ready=false`.

- item: Shell Core hardening skeleton
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: contract-level implementation present

- item: Runtime Catalog skeleton
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: schema, fixtures, package, and conformance present

- item: Agent Runtime skeleton
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: schema, fixtures, package, and conformance present

- item: Rust helper boundary skeleton
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: implementation present; `cd native/rust_helper && cargo test` passed on 2026-05-25

- item: Desktop Flutter skeleton
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: implementation present; `cd apps/desktop_flutter && flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, `flutter build linux`, and Linux launch smoke passed on 2026-05-25

- item: Setup Doctor skeleton
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: implementation present

- item: release-hardening documents
  classification: required_for_v1
  status: implementation present

## Current Release Blockers

- item: Linux desktop build and launch smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: Linux desktop build smoke and launch smoke passed on 2026-05-25 as development/verification proof.
  required_action: Keep Linux build and launch smoke passing, but do not treat them as Windows-first product proof.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows installer, first-run, and Setup Doctor release validation not passed
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: Windows project support, Flutter toolchain verification, analyze, test, build, and native launch smoke have passed, but installed-path Windows Setup Doctor, installer, and first-run evidence is missing from `release_evidence/windows_installed_smoke.json`.
  required_action: Run native Windows installed smoke collection with measured window, visible-surface, config JSON, audit write/read/delete, and non-synthetic Setup Doctor evidence; pass `python tooling\windows_release_evidence.py`.
  blocks_release: yes

- item: macOS planned portability target unverified
  classification: known_limitation
  reason: no macOS validation environment is currently available, so GUI-Shell v1.0 does not claim verified macOS support.
  required_action: Validate on a macOS host before claiming macOS support.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Windows Setup Doctor diagnostics not passed
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: Windows Setup Doctor installed-path diagnostics evidence is missing for the primary product target.
  required_action: Pass Windows Setup Doctor diagnostics smoke through `release_evidence/windows_installed_smoke.json`.
  blocks_release: yes

- item: implementation first-run smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: implementation first-run smoke creates config/audit paths and verifies installer/setup state is non-authoritative.
  required_action: Keep implementation first-run smoke passing; native Windows installed-path first-run remains a release blocker.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Shell Core persistence smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: integrated Shell Core release smoke saves and loads state snapshots.
  required_action: Keep persistence smoke passing on release candidates.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Audit chain verification smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: integrated Shell Core release smoke verifies audit chain linkage and detects tampering.
  required_action: Keep audit chain smoke passing on release candidates.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Runtime Catalog live/use smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: release smoke registers runtime and adapter manifests through RuntimeCatalog and confirms catalog authority remains false.
  required_action: Keep Runtime Catalog smoke passing.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Agent Runtime mock/reference smoke
  classification: required_for_v1
  reason: release smoke validates workspace boundary, secret path denial, shell command permission mapping, and auditable diff behavior.
  required_action: Keep Agent Runtime reference smoke passing.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Strict release validation not passed
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: completed Windows-first product release requires Windows strict validation.
  required_action: Pass `python3 tooling/validate_all.py --strict-release --desktop-platform=windows`; `--desktop-platform=all` may still fail because macOS is unverified, but that does not block Windows-first v1.0.
  blocks_release: yes

- item: Owner GO missing
  classification: release_blocker
  reason: release claim promotion requires owner approval.
  required_action: Obtain explicit owner GO.
  blocks_release: yes

## Post-v1 Scope

- item: Mobile full release
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 scope is Windows-first PC desktop unless owner explicitly includes mobile.
  required_action: Complete after v1.0 or update scope by owner instruction.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Multi-user mode
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 is single-user.
  required_action: Defer until post-v1 planning.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Cloud service
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 is local-first.
  required_action: Defer until post-v1 planning.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Marketplace
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 does not include runtime marketplace distribution.
  required_action: Defer until post-v1 planning.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Enterprise admin
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 is single-user desktop.
  required_action: Defer until post-v1 planning.
  blocks_release: no

- item: Full live third-party agent integrations
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: v1.0 requires generic Agent Runtime contract and mock/reference agent, not all live adapters.
  required_action: Add after v1.0 as adapter work.
  blocks_release: no

- item: BLUE-TANUKI product completion
  classification: post_v1_scope
  reason: BLUE-TANUKI is a consumer/reference runtime, not a GUI-Shell release gate.
  required_action: Complete as consumer integration after GUI-Shell v1.0 gate.
  blocks_release: no

## Known Limitations

- item: local single-user only
  classification: known_limitation
  reason: v1.0 product scope is Windows-first PC desktop, single-user, local-first.
  required_action: Keep README, CLAIM, and RELEASE_CHECKLIST aligned.
  blocks_release: no
